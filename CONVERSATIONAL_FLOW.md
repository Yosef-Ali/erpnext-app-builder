# 🤖 Conversational App Generation Flow

## How It Works Now

The app builder now uses a **conversational approach** - no more automatic navigation or buttons! The AI assistant guides you through each step.

# Dental Clinic Management System PRD

## Overview
A comprehensive dental clinic management system...

I've created a comprehensive PRD with:
• 5 business entities identified
• 3 workflows detected
• 8 requirement sections

📋 **Next Step**: I need to analyze this PRD to extract entities, workflows, and requirements.

Please check the **Analysis page** to review what I found, then type **"continue"** to proceed with template selection.

👉 Type: "check analysis" to open the analysis page
```

### User: "check analysis"

   - Patient Management
   - Appointment System
   - Billing Integration

**2. General Business Suite** (78% match)
   - Contact Management
   - Scheduling
   - Invoicing

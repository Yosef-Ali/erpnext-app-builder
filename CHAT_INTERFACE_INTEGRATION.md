# ðŸŽ‰ ERPNext App Builder - Chat Interface Integration

## New Chat Interface Features

Your new Chat interface is now integrated with the dental clinic workflow! Here's how it works:

### 1. **Template Gallery**
- Added "Dental Clinic Management" template in Healthcare category
- Shows with ðŸ¦· emoji
- Features: Patient Management, Appointments, Treatment Plans, Billing
- When clicked, it sets the input to "dental clinic app"

### 2. **Multimodal Input**
- Text prompt input (e.g., "dental clinic app")
- File upload support (PDF, images, markdown) - via paperclip icon
- Works with both simple prompts and full PRD documents

### 3. **Smart Processing**
When you type "dental clinic app" and click Run:
1. Detects it's a simple prompt (< 200 chars)
2. Calls `/hooks/generate-from-prompt` endpoint
3. Generates dental clinic PRD
4. Analyzes it to extract entities (Patient, Appointment, etc.)
5. Shows success message
6. Navigates to Analysis page with results

### 4. **Workflow Integration**
The chat now connects to the full workflow:
- **Chat** â†’ Enter prompt or select template
- **Analysis** â†’ Shows extracted entities and workflows
- **Templates** â†’ Suggests healthcare templates
- **Generator** â†’ Creates DocTypes and workflows
- **Quality Check** â†’ Validates and provides autofix

## How to Use

### Method 1: Template Selection
1. Click on "Dental Clinic Management" template in Healthcare tab
2. It fills the input with "dental clinic app"
3. Click "Run" button
4. System generates PRD and navigates to analysis

### Method 2: Direct Input
1. Type "dental clinic app" in the input field
2. Click "Run" button
3. Same workflow as above

### Method 3: Full PRD
1. Paste a complete PRD document (with # headers)
2. Click "Run" button
